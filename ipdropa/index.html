        We are one of the world's largest fashion retailers, with eight distinct brands.

        Inditex is one of the world's largest fashion retailers, with eight brands (Zara, Pull&Bear, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho, Zara Home and Uterqüe) selling in 202 markets through its online platform or its over 7,000 stores in 96 markets.
        
        We have come a long way since 1963, when we started out as a small family business in a workshop making women’s clothing.
        
        Over the years, our size may have changed, but one underlying idea has stayed the same – the customer is at the centre of everything we do.
        
        By working closely together as a single company globally focused on the key elements of fashion production –design, manufacture, distribution and retail– we brought our customers closer than ever to the products they wanted at affordable prices.
        
        The success of our first brand –Zara was followed by international expansion at the end of the 1980s and the successive launch of new brands, that now have an integrated model of stores and online.
         </p>

         <p class="Borde">
            As of 2012, it employed more than 44,000 
people worldwide. In 2014 the brand alone was valued at $19 billion, making it the most 
valuable brand among sports businesses. As of 2017, the Nike brand is valued at $29.6 billion
. Nike ranked No. 89 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.

The company was founded on January 25, 1964, as Blue Ribbon Sports, by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, 
and officially became Nike, Inc. on May 30, 1971. The company takes its name from Nike, the Greek goddess of victory.

    </h1>
        <p class="Borde-2">
            
            Inditex, the biggest fashion group in the world, operates over 7,200 stores in 93 markets worldwide. The company's flagship store is Zara, but it also owns the chains Zara Home, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Oysho, Pull and Bear, Stradivarius and Uterqüe. The majority of its stores are corporate-owned, while franchises are mainly conceded in countries where corporate properties cannot be foreign-owned.   
         <a><img class="dunk"></a></br>
        </a>
        The company operates a unique business model: instead of committing a large percentage of production for the next fashion season, the company commits a small amount and uses customer feedback and an efficient production network to replenish stores with new and different products weekly. New styles are prototyped in just 5 days and 60% of the manufacturing happens locally to shorten lead-times. In Zara stores, it can take a new garment as little as 15 days to go from design and production to store shelves.

        The quality of our products
        One of our main challenges is to offer ever more sustainable products. This means working hard on product design, on selecting the right processes and raw materials to be used, and on the whole production process in general, right through to the end of the product’s life cycle.
